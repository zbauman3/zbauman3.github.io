    <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
    <p>
      Five Lines is the modern name of an ancient Greek table game. No complete description of the game exists, but
      there have been several scholarly reconstructions - this is one such reconstruction.
    </p>
    <p>Two players move pieces clockwise on a board, and moves are determined by the roll of a die.
    </p>
    <p>The board consists of five lines with holes at both ends. The central line, also called the "sacred line", has
      five holes on each end. The winner is the first one to place all five of their pieces on the opposing
      player's sacred line.</p>
    <p>The lines themselves are not as important to the game as are the holes that reside on the lines. The game could
      be played with only holes, but the lines are useful as a guide to find the holes.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Start with each player's five pieces in the holes nearest to them on each line.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Player one rolls the dice, then finds a piece which can move to a hole on the opponent's sacred line,
          counting the number of holes clockwise.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Now the other player rolls the dice. This time, depending on the number rolled, there might be a choice of
          two moves - either to a hole on the opponent's sacred line, or to the hole left empty by player one.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Continue taking turns, moving a piece to the sacred line, or to an empty hole.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You must move a piece on each turn, even if your only choice is to move a piece already on the sacred line.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The first player to get all five of their pieces on the opponent's sacred line is the winner!</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
