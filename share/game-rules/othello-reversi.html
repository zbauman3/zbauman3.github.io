    <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
    <p>
      Othello (a.k.a Reversi) is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8-by-8 board using 64 identical
      game disks that are light on one side and dark on the other. In the 3-D printed version, the disks are flat on one
      side and indented on the other. Each player chooses one side to use throughout the game.
    </p>
    <p>To start the game, each player places two of their own disks in diagonally-adjacent spots at the center of
      the board. These four pieces will form a square at the center of the board.</p>
    <p>A turn consists of placing one piece and potentially "outflanking" your opponent's discs, then flipping the
      outflanked discs to your own. To outflank means to place a disc on the board so that your opponent's row (or rows)
      of discs is bordered at each end by your own discs. A "row" may be made up of one or more discs.</p>
    <p>When all playable empty squares are filled, the player with more disks showing wins the
      game. It is possible for a game to end before all 64 squares are filled.</p>

    <h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Discs may only be outflanked as a direct result of a move and must fall in the direct line of the disc placed
          down.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If on your turn you cannot outflank and flip at least one opposing disc, your turn is forfeited and your
          opponent moves again. However, if a move is available to you, you may not forfeit your turn. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Players may not skip over their own discs to outflank an opposing disc. Meaning, only the opponent's discs
          between your placed disc and the nearest of your own disks are flipped.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>All discs outflanked in any one move must be flipped, even if it is to the player's advantage not to flip
          them at all. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Once a disc is placed on a square, it can never be moved to another square later in the game. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>When it is no longer possible for either player to move, the game is over. Discs are counted and the player
          with the majority of their disks showing is the winner.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
