  <h1>Nedge</h1>
  <section aria-labelledby="description">
    <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
    <p>Nedge is a boardgame for two players. The core of the game consist of four distinct geometric patterns: "circular
      grooves", "triangular grooves", "lake holes", and "square holes". Patterns are on both sides of square tiles.
      Every combination is represented through the game, so you have access to 16 tiles in total - four patterns
      possibles on both sides of a tile.</p>
    <p>At the beginning of the game, no tile is present on the board. Every player takes turn, and can do one move as
      described below. If you can't make one of the moves described below, then your opponent is the winner!</p>
    <p>The board and the guides aren't necessary to play, but it helps to stack the tiles, and avoid them falling
      eventually.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Move One: Place a tile on an empty hole. The player can choose whichever geometric pattern of the choosen
          tile will stay on top.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Move Two: Stack a tile or tiles on another. The tile or tiles can be placed on another tile if, and only if,
          both geometric pattern at the top of both stacks are the same before stacking those two stacks. If the player
          takes a tile, they must take the whole column on which this tile is staying.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Move Four: Reverse a whole stack by taking the stack with their hand and fingers, and apply a 180Â° flip to
          the whole stack. The tile at the bottom will be now at the top, and the tile at the top will be at the bottom.
          You can't flip stacks more than 3 turns in a row, and you can't flip back the stack that have
          just been flipped by the other player on the previous turn.</p>
